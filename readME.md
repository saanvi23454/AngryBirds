# AngryBirds

**AngryBirds** is a 2D physics-based game inspired by the iconic *Angry Birds*. Players use their slingshot skills to launch birds and destroy the mischievous pigs hiding behind structures. The game challenges your aim and strategy as you tackle each level with unique bird abilities, randomized levels, and structures that require careful planning to overcome.

## üìú **Backstory**
Once upon a time, a peaceful bird kingdom was disrupted by cunning pigs who stole their precious eggs. Driven by anger and a quest for justice, the birds decided to fight back! Armed with unique abilities and a trusty slingshot, the birds take on the pigs, destroying their defenses one structure at a time. Will you help the birds reclaim their eggs and restore peace to their kingdom?

## üöÄ **How to Run**
1. **Dependencies**:  
   Ensure you have the following installed:
   - **Java Development Kit (JDK) 21** or later.  
   - **LibGDX library** and **JUnit testing framework**.

2. **Building the Project**:  
   - Clone the repository and open it in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.  
   - Use **Gradle** to build the project.  
     ```
     ./gradlew build
     ```
   - Run the main class to start the game.

## üéÆ **Gameplay Overview**
- **Enter the Level**: Start the level with a slingshot loaded with birds.  
- **Launch Birds**: Drag and aim to set the trajectory, then release to launch birds.  
- **Destroy Structures**: Strategically target structures made of wood, glass, or other materials.  
- **Defeat Pigs**: Reduce the pigs' health through collisions and eliminate them to clear the level.  
- **Retry or Progress**: If pigs survive, retry the level; otherwise, advance to the next one.  
- **Special Abilities**: Activate unique bird abilities with the spacebar.  
- **Save and Load Game**: Progress can be saved and loaded to resume later.

## üß™ **JUnit Testing**
The project includes the following JUnit tests for quality assurance:

### **SlingTest**
1. **testSingletonInstance**: Verifies the singleton behavior of the `Slingshot` class.  
2. **testStartDrag**: Tests the drag functionality of the slingshot.  
3. **testRelease**: Validates the release mechanism and position reset.  
4. **testDispose**: Ensures the dispose method executes without errors.

### **BirdTest**
1. **testInitialization**: Tests the initialization of the `Bird` object.  
2. **testSpecialFeature**: Verifies the activation and usage of the special feature.  
3. **testGetHealth**: Validates the default health value.  
4. **testDestroySelf**: Verifies the destruction behavior.  
5. **testGetMass**: Checks the mass of the bird body.  
6. **testGetDensity**: Validates the density of the bird body.

### **BoxTest**
1. **testInitialization**: Tests the initialization of the `Box` object.  
2. **testGetHealth**: Validates the default health value.  
3. **testDestroySelf**: Verifies the destruction behavior.  
4. **testGetMass**: Checks the mass of the box body.  
5. **testGetDensity**: Validates the density of the box body.

### **PigTest**
1. **testInitialization**: Tests the initialization of the `Pig` object.  
2. **testGetHealth**: Validates the default health value.  
3. **testDestroySelf**: Verifies the destruction behavior.  
4. **testGetMass**: Checks the mass of the pig body.  
5. **testGetDensity**: Validates the density of the pig body.

To run the JUnit tests:
1. Navigate to the `test/java` directory.  
2. Run the test files individually using your IDE or a testing framework.

## üìê **Design Patterns**
### **1. Singleton Pattern**
- **Class Involved**: `Slingshot`  
- **Description**: Ensures only one instance of the `Slingshot` class exists throughout the game, providing a single point of interaction for the slingshot mechanism.  
- **Benefits**:  
  - Ensures global access to the slingshot instance.  
  - Prevents resource wastage by creating a single instance.  

### **2. Factory Method Pattern**
- **Classes Involved**: `Pig`, `Box`, `Bird`  
- **Description**: Used to create game entities flexibly without specifying their exact class. Enables easy extension for new entity types.  
- **Benefits**:  
  - Promotes clean and maintainable code by decoupling object creation from the main logic.  
  - Simplifies extending the system for new entity types (e.g., special pigs or birds).  

---

## üíæ **Serialization**
The game supports saving the state of the current level. This feature allows you to save progress, including game attributes, when you pause and quit in the middle of a level. Upon returning to the game, you will be given the option to restore the saved state. Note that only one level's state can be saved at a time.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Future Improvements**
- **Additional Levels**: Introduce more levels with diverse challenges.  
- **Star Rating System**: Earn stars based on your score or performance.  
- **Power-Ups**: Add wildcards, a power sling, and other features to improve trajectory and gameplay.  
- **Advanced Graphics**: Enhance visuals for a more immersive experience.
