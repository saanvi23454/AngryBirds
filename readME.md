# AngryBirds

**AngryBirds** is a 2D physics-based game inspired by the iconic *Angry Birds*. Players use their slingshot skills to launch birds and destroy the mischievous pigs hiding behind structures. The game challenges your aim and strategy as you tackle each level with unique bird abilities, randomized levels, and structures that require careful planning to overcome.

## üìú **Backstory**
Once upon a time, a peaceful bird kingdom was disrupted by cunning pigs who stole their precious eggs. Driven by anger and a quest for justice, the birds decided to fight back! Armed with unique abilities and a trusty slingshot, the birds take on the pigs, destroying their defenses one structure at a time. Will you help the birds reclaim their eggs and restore peace to their kingdom?

## üöÄ **How to Run**
1. **Dependencies**:  
   Ensure you have the following installed:
   - **Java Development Kit (JDK) 21** or later.  
   - **LibGDX library** and **JUnit testing framework**.

2. **Building the Project**:  
   - Clone the repository and open it in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

## üéÆ **Gameplay Overview**
- **Enter the Level**: Start the level with a slingshot loaded with birds.  
- **Launch Birds**: Drag and aim to set the trajectory, then release to launch birds.  
- **Destroy Structures**: Strategically target structures made of wood, glass, or other materials.  
- **Defeat Pigs**: Reduce the pigs' health through collisions and eliminate them to clear the level.  
- **Retry or Progress**: If pigs survive, retry the level; otherwise, advance to the next one.  
- **Special Abilities**: Activate unique bird abilities with the spacebar.  
- **Save and Load Game**: Progress can be saved and loaded to resume later.

## üéÆ **Design Patterns**

### 1. **Singleton Pattern**
   - **Class Involved**: `Slingshot`
   - **Description**: 
     The **Singleton Pattern** is used to ensure that only one instance of the `Slingshot` class exists throughout the lifetime of the game. This is important because we want to maintain a single point of interaction for the slingshot mechanism during the gameplay.
     
     The singleton pattern ensures that the `Slingshot` instance is created lazily and only once. Subsequent calls to the `getInstance()` method will return the same instance.
     
   - **Benefits**: 
       - Ensures global access to the slingshot instance.
       - Prevents multiple instances from being created, thus saving resources.

### 2. **Factory Method Pattern**
   - **Classes Involved**: `Pig`, `Box`, `Bird`
   - **Description**: 
     The **Factory Method Pattern** is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created. This pattern allows for more flexibility, as subclasses can modify or extend the creation process.
     
     In this project, the creation of different game entities (such as `Pig`, `Box`, `Bird`) is done via constructor methods, which are treated as a form of the factory method. This allows you to extend the system with new types of entities easily, without modifying existing code.
     
   - **Benefits**:
       - Enables creating new types of entities in a flexible manner.
       - Decouples the object creation process from the main gameplay logic, promoting clean and maintainable code.
       - Facilitates easy extension for new types of entities in the future (e.g., different types of pigs or birds).
